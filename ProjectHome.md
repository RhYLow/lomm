Program to help manage playing ABC files in the game Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO).

## Not Dead Yet! ##
I have almost dug myself out of the hole I got into by doing LOMM beta 2 instead of some high-priority and paying) work :-) I have some nice improvements for the final release and am excited to get it out to you all.

Also, I'm thinking of moving from code.google.com to codeplex for hosting. There isn't anything really _wrong_ with code.google, but codeplex is much nicer to use (for example, you can get email notification when a release is available and it has discussion threads as well as wiki). I doubt anyone cares, but if so, speak up!

See you all in-game soon... as soon as I get my client happy again.

## Thank you! ##
Version 1.0.4 has passed 800 downloads! And 150+ of the 2.0 beta! For something I wrote for my own use and put out there for fun, I'm amazed. Thank you all.

## LOMM 2.0 Beta 2 is here ##
Check it out in the downloads page. This release includes toolbars and macros as well as a partial help file.

### New preview with screenshots of Beta 2 macro features ###

2.0 Beta 2 is almost ready. It will include macros, some cleanup to the overall UI, and icons! Icons in the menus, on relevant buttons, on the tab panes, ... Icon everywhere! I think it makes the app a lot easier to use quicky and generally ties things together helpfully. That is thanks to the FamFamFam Silk Icon set (http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/).

### 2.0 Beta 1 is here! ###
Adventurous users can download the 2.0 beta. This new release includes:
  * Support for multiple songs in one abc file
  * Syntax highlighting in the ABC editor
  * Lyrics support when playing
The next beta should include the advanced macros. I have them working here but need to polish up the editor so you can create your own without editing xml files :-)
**This is beta software:** I haven't had any problems, but **back up your abc files before installing**. This software _does_ edit files, after all, and I don't want you to lose anything if you uncover a bug.

Speaking of bugs, please send any bug reports or questions to me here by (in order of preference) this web site, email (carborunda.riverside@pobox.com), PM on the LOTRO forums (username Xowl), or in-game mail (Carborunda on Brandywine). Thanks!

Enjoy!
