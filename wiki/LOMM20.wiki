Totally new preview of 2.0!

I really want feedback on all of this.

----

=Music Features=
Music UI is now split into two parts. One is for the edit/compose/test mode and has a full-width editing area and ABC syntax highlighting:

There is also Play mode for helping recite lyrics:

The highlighting is a bit system-intensive when an ABC file is opened or edited, so it can be disabled if you prefer. It is noticeably painful on my large test file ().

I need to work something up for the X tag support. Tuple and dynamic support should be just more syntax highlighting, which I can add easily.

=Macro Features=

All-new command automation! Instead of the pre-defined list of "role-play friendly" commands from 1.x you can now create and organize your own actions. 

Instead of "macro", they're called "emotes" in the UI, which is entirely wrong and may change. An "emote" consists of one or more actions. Actions come in a bunch of types:

For each type you can specify the text or action to take. For instance, for the LOTRO command type, the list of actions from the key mapping panel appears:

Allowing you to create macros like:

=Other Stuff=
There are some other features coming as well:
  * Per-character options (including emotes)
  * Keep LOTRO sound playing when LOMM has the focus
  * "One of many" emote actions (to say one item out of a list, for example)
  * Options dialog to clean up the menu UI

And some "still might happen" items
  * Customize what's marked in the ABC highlighting
  * Float a toolbar or emotes separate from the main LOMM UI
  * Radial menu for emotes (this is less likely, but I really want it)
  * Invisible buttons to float over your on-screen quickbars (I can go on about this if people want; I think it's a cool idea)
