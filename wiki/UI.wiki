=The main LOMM UI=

[http://lomm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Screenshots/MainUI.jpg]

To play music, you 
  # Select the ABC file you want in the top pane
  # edit it if you want in the bottom pane
  # use the *Toggle /music* and *Play* buttons as needed.

The *Toggle /music* button returns focus to LOMM.

The *Play* button has options if you context-click or click the down-arrow:

  * *Play* executes `/play <name>`
  * *Wait to play* executes `/play <name> sync`
  * *Start group* executes `/playstart`
  * All of these return focus to LOTRO

==Menus==

  * *Settings | Always On Top* is a toggle. While it is on LOMM will stay visible even when LOTRO would otherwise cover it
  * *Settings | Opacity* allows you to set the LOMM interface to be 30% opaque (70% transparent) to fully opaque. This is mostly useful when Always On Top is enabled.
  * *Settings | Editor Font Size* allows you to specify a the size of text in the edit window below the file list.

All of these settings are saved for the next time you run LOMM. The position and size of the LOMM window is also saved.

  * *Help | ABC Quick Reference...* shows a reference page on LOTROs subset of the ABC standard ([http://lomm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/LOTROMusicManager/Help/ABCRef.rtf This RTF File]).

=Emotes=

The emotes menus do not include all the emotes in the game, just the ones I find useful when socializing. Speak up if you want changes. 

LOMM keeps focus when sending an emote.
